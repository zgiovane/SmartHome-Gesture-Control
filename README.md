# SmartHome Gesture Control Application

## Overview
Welcome to the SmartHome Gesture Control Application! This application focuses on developing an application service that enables control of SmartHome devices through gestures. Whether you're interested in enhancing convenience or accessibility for the elderly and individuals with disabilities, this application provides a flexible solution that can be adapted to various SmartHome environments.

## Functionality
The SmartHome Gesture Control Application offers the following functionality:

- **Gesture Classification**: The application is capable of classifying specific gestures performed by users. Whether it's turning on lights, adjusting thermostat settings, or controlling fans, the application can recognize various gestures and translate them into corresponding actions.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leveraging pre-trained machine learning models, the application accurately classifies gestures with high precision. Through training and testing of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, the application ensures robust gesture recognition capabilities.

- **Flexibility and Customization**: The modular design of the application allows for flexibility and customization according to specific SmartHome setups and user preferences. Whether you're controlling a single device or managing an entire SmartHome ecosystem, the application can be tailored to meet your needs.

- **Integration with SmartHome Devices**: Once a gesture is recognized, the application seamlessly integrates with SmartHome devices to execute the corresponding actions. Whether it's turning off lights, adjusting temperature settings, or activating appliances, the application ensures smooth control of SmartHome devices through intuitive gestures.
